PizzaLoco Management System with Java, Spring JPA, Spring Security, and MySQL

Description:
Our project introduces a tailored Pizzeria Management System crafted with Java, Spring JPA, Spring Security, and MySQL, designed specifically to streamline operations for pizzerias while ensuring data security and efficient management of pizzas, orders, and customer information.

Key Features:

Menu Management: The system allows pizzeria owners to effortlessly manage their menu, including adding new pizzas, updating existing ones, and setting prices. With Spring JPA, changes to the menu are seamlessly persisted in the database, ensuring accurate representation of available items.

Customer Management: Customer information is securely stored within the system, allowing pizzeria staff to manage customer accounts, track order history, and provide personalized service. Spring Security ensures that customer data is protected with robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for each query.

Security and Access Control: With Spring Security, the system implements stringent security measures to safeguard sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access. Role-based access control ensures that only authorized personnel can access certain functionalities, such as editing menu items or viewing customer information.
